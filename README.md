Backend dev guy, often in and out of the Python ecosystem. Been coding for about a year now and drinking coffee even way longer. I give life to software ideas - although you may not see them, given they're often "in the back," somewhere on the web. If you're hiring, let's chat.

Robots and autonomous systems, I love them. That's how I drove myself to earn a bachelor's in **mechatronics engineering**, and that pretty much set me up for life with foundations in electrical and electronics and <u>coding.</u>
